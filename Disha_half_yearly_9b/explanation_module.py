"""
Module-
->A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application is called a module.
->In this file we are storing the code as a function i.e using the 'def' keyword and creating a module.
->We will call the function for the required output.
->Making a module saves time and later can be used in future for other purposes.


How does the module work-
->first using a the 'def' keyword make a function for your code.
for example-
def name_of_the_function():
                        write your code

->Now you can call the function.
for example-
from your_module_name import name_of_the_function
name_of_the_funtion()
